# password-randomizer

## Description

This application is called Password Randomizer.
It is a password generator that generates a random password for users.
The greatest part about this generator is it can be used by anyone!
This application is ideal for users who need strong passwords,
especially at a whim.
This generator spits out a series of randomized characters for users
every time the "Generate Password" button is clicked.

## Installation

To utilize this password randomizer,
a user clicks the "Generate Password" button.
The application will then prompt the user with a series of questions,
"Enter the length of the password. (8-128 Characters)"
"Include lowercase letters?"
"Include uppercase letters?"
"Include numbers?"
"Include special characters?"
The generator will then give you the randomized password, given the criteria is met.

Note ** If a user clicks "Cancel" instead of "Ok" to the above prompts, the generator will
return an "Invalid" message and the user will have to restart the generator.


## Usage

This randomizer is great for users with access to senstive information.
Some users can go for an easy to remember password,
and can tend to go for things they relate to, making the password easier to guess
if one were to try to hack that user.
As previously stated,
this application is great for users who need strong passwords at a whim.
For example, say an employer needs a list of passwords for staff to access some private information.
Simply keep clicking the "Generate Password" button,
and you will have as many secure passwords as you need.
